      <em><h3>Buddleja davidii</h3></em>
      <p>This flower is really pretty but when i was investigating this flower, it turns that the plant is actually invasive... it was imported from somewhere in Asia a long time ago and has since spread to a lot of Europe and other countries on this side of the globe because the environment is more suitable to its development. Still it is a very strong sight. It's really impressive!! The elongated shape with lots of little flowers seems makes it look like a small community. And the colour is so tempting...

The light purple is perhaps my favourite colour and it looks extremely beautiful in the muted and industrial urban colours of the city. In the picture, the flower is stretching through a grate of sorts, and i found it close to my home, just up the road, in what looks like an abandoned building lot. It still grows there. But what i meant to note was that the flower was in a context of urban decay. The building lot was place to some nondescript wreckage and old wood, and looking across the grate into the empty space, it sloped down into an open space behind the buildings that surround it, with even more wild growths and the waste of an abandoned construction.

That's what i remember the most about this flower, the fact that it was growing in a pretty ugly place. I guess that's what flowers do. That's their lot in life.

(06-10-24 Update)

The flower i took the picture of is no more. The growth has been removed, probably to make way for a new construction in its spot. This is a bit depressing. Not sure what to feel about this right now. Perhaps the strongest i've bonded with a particular plant, in a particular place, that i know was destroyed wantonly and for purposes of urbanization. I wish, thought it is perhaps unfair of me, the flower had stayed there, instead of being removed for the apartments that will take its place.

<p><i><b>Buddleja davidii</b></i> (spelling variant <i>Buddleia davidii</i>), also called <b>summer lilac</b>, <b>butterfly-bush</b>, or <b>orange eye</b>, is a species of flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae, native to Sichuan and Hubei provinces in central China, and also Japan. It is widely used as an ornamental plant, and many named varieties are in cultivation. The genus was named <i>Buddleja</i> after Reverend Adam Buddle, an English botanist. The species name <i>davidii</i> honors the French missionary and explorer in China, Father Armand David, who was the first European to report the shrub. It was found near Yichang by Dr Augustine Henry about 1887 and sent to St Petersburg.  Another botanist-missionary in China, Jean-AndrÃ© SouliÃ©, sent seed to the French nursery Vilmorin, and <i>B. davidii</i> entered commerce in the 1890s.
</p><p><i>B. davidii</i> was accorded the RHS Award of Merit (AM) in 1898, and the Award of Garden Merit (AGM) in 1941.
