            <p>This flower is really pretty but when i was investigating this flower, it turns that the plant is actually invasive... it was imported from somewhere in Asia a long time ago and has since spread to a lot of Europe and other countries on this side of the globe because the environment is more suitable to its development. Still it is a very strong sight. It's really impressive!! The elongated shape with lots of little flowers seems makes it look like a small community. And the colour is so tempting...

The light purple is perhaps my favourite colour and it looks extremely beautiful in the muted and industrial urban colours of the city. In the picture, the flower is stretching through a grate of sorts, and i found it close to my home, just up the road, in what looks like an abandoned building lot. It still grows there. But what i meant to note was that the flower was in a context of urban decay. The building lot was place to some nondescript wreckage and old wood, and looking across the grate into the empty space, it sloped down into an open space behind the buildings that surround it, with even more wild growths and the waste of an abandoned construction.

That's what i remember the most about this flower, the fact that it was growing in a pretty ugly place. I guess that's what flowers do. That's their lot in life.
