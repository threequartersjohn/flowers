      <em><h3>Hibiscus syriacus</h3></em>
      <p>I don't actually remember where i saw this flower. Maybe back home.. not sure. The background isn't helping. But anyway i really like this one. The petals very visibly interlocking below and above one another. And also the dual tone of the petal is very pretty.

The name "Rose of Sharon" is probably the most interesting bit. Apparently "Rose of Sharon" refers to a number of flowers, as different places around the world have given it to different flowers, and the name itself comes from a sentence in the Tanahk (the Hebrew bible, also Miqra): "I am the rose of Sharon, a rose of the valley".

This sentence seems to have first appeared in this specific translation in the King James Version. It seems that people have taken at times to name actual flowers that could not have been the flowers referenced as the rose of valley after the aforementioned Sharon. It's a fascinating curia. You have to wonder what people were thinking when naming them such. Were they thinking "This flower is SO beautiful, it deserves to have been the Rose of Sharon". Or perhaps they were sold as Rose of Sharon, in an attempt to fool potential buyers, and the name thus stuck. But it's interesting for it to have happened in multiple places over the world.

<p><i><b>Hibiscus syriacus</b></i> is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. 
It is native to areas of east Asia, but widely introduced elsewhere, including much of Europe and North America. It was given the epithet <i>syriacus</i> because it had been collected from gardens in Syria.
Common names include the <b>rose of Sharon</b>, (especially in North America), <b>Syrian ketmia</b>,
<b>shrub althea</b>
(or simply <b>althea</b>), 
and <b>rose mallow</b>  (in the United Kingdom). It is the national flower of South Korea and is mentioned in the South Korean national anthem.
