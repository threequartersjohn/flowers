            <p>This flower i saw on Morocco. I went there in a trip for a few days and visited Marrakesh. Days after the trip and i'm still not sure what to think of it... i have lots of thoughts about the place and the trip. We had two full days there, excluding the days before and after traveling into and out of the place. The first day we saw the old town, since we were sleeping close to the big square near the medina and that's where we walked. We visited the Bahia Palace and then walked the medina. The second day, we walked to what seemed a more modern side of town, and visited the Yves Saint Laurent museum. 

The place tired me in some way that i have not yet rested. It's been a week since our going there and i'm still somehow... feeling displaced back home. I'm not sure what malady is this that keeps me out of touch with normal life even having slept and eaten well for days. I guess i must return to work, to feel the coming and going of people and the rhythms of regular life. I hope that's what it is. I admit, the first day in the old city drained me in a particular way, like that of visiting a big fair and needing a good rest the following day away from other people. We were approached so frequently by people who saw us as potential costumers, it eventually dawned on me that i was becoming part of a ritual that was already there for me to walk into. The requesting, the denial, after just one day i felt as trained in telling these sellers "Thanks, but no" (or rather the "merci, mais non", which is probably incorrect) as they might have been in approaching someone they know will most likely rebuke their approach. I suppose those who live there are familiar with this dynamic, or are perhaps not approached lacking our evident look of outsiders. But to me this was very tiring. I was not expecting to be that affected honestly... but i admit it was not easy. That first day we returned to the hotel room for a rest before dinner and i was dreading leaving again and crossing those same streets and knowing how much it would demand of me. 

But it wasn't all bad, the second day we walked towards another side of the city and it was a much more relaxed day. We walked slowly in uncrowded streets, saw newer and bigger buildings, and i enjoyed what was probably my favorite panna cotta so far. Softly silky cold base with an incredible orange cream. Very good oranges in general! We had an orange juice every morning and it was always a pleasure. Anyway. The whole day revitalized me. Today i appreciate the trip and the places we visited. But i should have chosen a different city honestly, or i will chose a different city next time i visit the country. Maybe Tangier? I've always like the name, and it looks a fair bit more mediterranean. 

This flower... i'm not sure where i saw it. I can't even recall if it was a tended garden, but from the information i can find about it, it seems like it probably was tended, since there is no information about it growing naturally outside the southern edges of the continent, in Southern Africa. It's really beautiful, with a light hue of blue that looked absolutely stunning in very sunny Morocco. So glad i kept this picture of it.
