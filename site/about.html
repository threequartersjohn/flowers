<h1>what's this about</h1>

<p class="decorate-interior-links">
    Over time i have noticed that i take pictures of photos and then use the feature in my phone to look them up in the internet and read their Wikipedia articles. I enjoy this process, it feels natural: i see something outside that's interesting, and i can investigate it using a picture that i took, there on the spot or some time after. And the way it goes as it tends to with Wikipedia, i always learn something interesting. Flowers are actually a really big part of human societies, and in our relationship with them we can see the ways that humans relate to themselves and to the natural world.

    I have wanted to do a blog of some kind for a while now. But i didn't want to do something generic... creating this blog about flowers that i find interesting enough to take a picture of is a way to have <em>some</em> focus but not <em>too</em> much focus. And so i can take this opportunity to learn some new technology and at the same time be creative in some small way.

    This blog is built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> which i have always been interested in. The pictures are taken with an iPhone 13. It has a very good camera! Not a <em>great</em> camera, the bokeh is strange and the lens isn't <em>that</em> good and the colours have a <em>specific</em> resolve to them that i wish i found more interesting. But it's good enough for this purpose. I also have other cameras: a Nikon FE, and Yashica 635, both very good cameras that i use for other things.

    So please, grab a nice cup of your favourite drink, go <a href="/">back to the homepage</a>, look at the pictures, and read some words.
